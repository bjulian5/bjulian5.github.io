      "highlights": [
        "Tech lead for a team of 5 engineers, building Spice: a general infrastructure control plane framework. Enabling rapid development of standardized control planes, accelerating Data Platform, ML, and Fleet Management opereations at Stripe.",
        "Led the entire project lifecycle, from conception to implementation. Conducted customer interviews, created an MVP, proposed and reviewed designs with technical leadership, scoped work, and guided the team in implementing core components. The resulting framework empowered Data Platform and ML teams to build control planes that dramatically improved efficiency: reduced Flink App provisioning time from days to minutes, decreased ML feature release time from ~1 week to under 48 hours, and enabled a projected $9-$12 million savings in fraud loss budget through ML 1-click feature deployment.",
        "Implemented core functionality for Space Station, a secure AWS interface, and led initiatives to remove powerful AWS credentials from most laptops, enforcing security invariants on 99.5% of AWS modifications. Spearheaded operational improvements, reducing command startup time by 75% and saving 800 engineering hours annually.",
        "Optimized cross-region infrastructure, reducing security group rule propagation time by 90%, improving stability of distributed systems that depend on cross-region traffic, and eliminating $3.7M in annual AWS data transfer costs.",
        "Led comprehensive Terraform improvements, including: custom Bazel rules that reduced CI times by 60%, saving $2.7M annually; migration of thousands of modules to newer versions; automated PR-based plan generation; and health-checked automated Terraform deployments, improving developer productivity, reducing infrastructure drift, and increasing overall reliability.",
        "Led critical workstreams in Stripe's Prometheus migration, implementing automated Terraform deployments to migrate thousands of alert rules. This significantly accelerated the migration process, enabling Stripe to discontinue its SignalFX contract by the renewal date, resulting in multi-million dollar annual savings.",
        "Mentored and coached 2 interns as part of our DEI mentorship program, both of whom converted to full-time roles.",
        "Provided ongoing mentorship to multiple team engineers, including guiding an mid-level engineer in planning a critical 6-month fleet migration, and supporting a senior engineer in leading improvements to operational posture of various internal systems. These efforts resulted in de-risked project approaches, clear milestones, and significant enhancements to system reliability and monitoring."
